# Project motivation
There are a few YouTube channels that want to watch regularly, mostly related to the news and self help/self reflection content.
Unfortunately I found that once I am on YouTube for any reason, I tend to get distracted and end up wasting a lot of time.

My Solution to this was to build this simple YouTube UI.
It pulls the URLs for the videos I am interested in and then embeds them into a web page.
This makes it vary easy to go though all the videos I am interested in, while avoiding distractions.

# Project Architecture
I am currently using Rocket and Yew for this project. 
These project are both way more powerful of frameworks then would be required for such a simple web app.
However they were the tools I was already familiar with, and for a quick and dirty project like this, that is the most important factor.
